  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cool, so one of the features my latest client is asking me to do is adding is an image gallery of their studios.  After searching around for a little bit, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://github.com/hecticjeff/fancybox-rails">Fancybox Rails</a> gem.  Cool, let&rsquo;s check it out.</p>

<p>This gem is great, it adds all the assets required for <a href="http://fancybox.net/">Fancybox</a> to your assets, and all you have to do is add:</p>

<p>//= require fancybox</p>

<p>to your application.js file and:</p>

<p>*= require fancy box</p>

<p>to your application.css file.</p>

<p>Awesome.  Now that all of that is squared away, let&rsquo;s get to work.  In our controller we are working with this array:</p>

<p><img src="/images/galleryall.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>This is an array of all the pictures we are working with.  If we want to loop through all of these, we use the following code:</p>

<p><img src="/images/fancyloop.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>If we throw on a little jQuery, we get a workable Fancybox:</p>

<p><img src="/images/fancycode.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>What happens here is were are looking through all the paintings in the gallery and setting them to the same :rel.  This allows Fancybox to know all images with :rel &ldquo;studio_images&rdquo; is to be grouped together in a gallery.</p>

<p>The problem here is that we now have eight links, with all eight links opening up to the same gallery.  That&rsquo;s not good, we want one link to open to all of the images in the gallery.  Cool, let&rsquo;s solve this problem.</p>

<p>How about we make two instance variables in the controller, one for the first image, and one for the rest, this way if we ever delete the first image, another will replace it.  The benefit here is that there will be no image duplication because between the two arrays, we will have all the images, but no duplicates.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fancycontroller.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>So now we have these two variable, and we need to make a link in the view to open the gallery.  Let&rsquo;s do that:</p>

<p><img src="/images/click_thing.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>If you have noticed, both lines of code have different id&rsquo;s, can you guess why?  If we have both lines of code, we will have eight different links.  We only want one link, let&rsquo;s hide the second array.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fancyhide.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>And you are left with one link which points to all the images in your gallery, good work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ll admit, I am not an authority figure when it comes to front end.  I&rsquo;m not talking about things like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, I&rsquo;m talking about getting super down and dirty within a stylesheet.</p>

<p>I had a fun little problem to solve yesterday when working on the site for my current client.  The client wanted the page the user was currently on to be highlighted in the navbar.</p>

<p>I immediately thought to add some sort of conditional, but went strait to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> to see what programmers before me have done.</p>

<p>Turns out, there are two ways you can do something like this.  In both scenarios, we are going to create a helper method, but the helper method can check different things.</p>

<p>For those who are not making a navbar dynamically, I would suggest using the following:</p>

<p><img src="/images/controllermethod.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/controllercode.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>This way, you can have the helper method return some thing (in this case, the name of the new class) depending on what controller the request is using.</p>

<p>If you are going to dynamically create the navbar, I suggest you do something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/pathmethod.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/pathcode.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>This way, the helper is checking the request url, and simply passing in the path.  I actually found this second way of doing this buggy because the root path becomes highlighted for all the other paths.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So after I successfully jail-rigged my blog, I can now make new posts.  I have a bunch that I want to talk about, but one I wanted touch on today was serializing attributes for a model.</p>

<p>Here is the scenario.  One of the index pages for my currently client lists all the items they have available for rent (it&rsquo;s a music company).  They have microphones, computers, instruments, anything you could rent.  It&rsquo;s probably about 10 different categories of products that a customer can rent.</p>

<p>I built the back end with <a href="http://www.activeadmin.info/">ActiveAdmin</a> so the client can easily change the content of the site.  The previous developer had hard coded all of the content, and the client was not comfortable going into the actual code to make changes.</p>

<p>So we have a rental page that lists all the items for rent.  Because there are 10 different categories of items, do I want to make 10 different models and do the proper associations, or because the items only have names do I want to come up with something else?</p>

<p>I found out that I could serialize an attribute in rails.  Its super simple:</p>

<p><img src="/images/serialize.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>What we are doing his is simple, rather than creating a whole nothing model and creating the association, this model (staff), can have many titles, but those titles cannot have many attributes.</p>

<p>This was a really good way for allow the client to add many single attribute attributes to a model.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Everyone Who Has Read My Blog,</p>

<p>According to my watch, it should have been about two months since I last blogged.  These past two months have been a very challenging time for me as my father recently passed away.</p>

<p>I will be starting up my blog again soon as within the last week or so I have been able to get back to programming.  One of the things I have been working on has been speeding up my Workout App and adding Eager Loading into my application.  Thus far I have eliminated a little over 60% of my queries.</p>

<p>Actually it&rsquo;s probably better I do some stuff now.  In my Workout App the individual workouts #show page has a visual representation of a users workout through the Google Charts.  Originally, my #show action looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstshow.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Very strait forward, I had created a :graph method that would all the charts to work.  When I do this, here is what the queries look like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/firstquery.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Yuck, that&rsquo;s 18 queries, and although it&rsquo;s not very slow on my current app, if this workout had more than a few exercises with a few sets, it could be much slower.</p>

<p>Then I started looking into Eager Loading, which allowed me to turn my #show action into:</p>

<p><img src="/images/secondshow.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Here, I am loading the routine for the action, that routine belongs to a user and has many lifts.  Those lifts belong to an exercise and have many infos.  So now when I Eager Load into the instance of routine and run the :graph method, we get this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/secondquery.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Just 5 queries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone,</p>

<p>Unfortunately that last few days I have not been able to update my blog due to a family emergency.  The good news is that I have still been finding a few hours here and there to get some coding work in.  In the past few days I have authenticated users with Devise and Omiauth (together) as well as added the Letsrate gem to my workout application (allowing each exercise to have a 5 star rating).  I plan on writing at least 2 post from these topics when I get a chance.  I also spun up an app with the ActiveAdmin gem but I will only be giving a link to the pseudo (a little outdated) blog I followed for it.  I will also be added a post for some of the gotcha&rsquo;s I encountered while setting up Rspec and FactoryGirl today.</p>

<p>The apps I made thus far have all been deployed following these guidelines:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Spike Grobstein = Beast</a></p>

<p>If you were able to successfully deploy your rails app to production via Capistrano you have done all the heavy lifting already.  If you make new changes that you would like to push to the server all you have to do is <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_GonzGonz">thanks for my boy Chris Gonzales</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go into your public folder on your local machine and write the command:</li>
</ol>


<p>cap deploy:setup</p>

<ol>
<li>Follow it up by the command:</li>

<p>cap deploy</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I worked on another search gem this time being <a href="https://github.com/ernie/ransack">Ransack</a>.  In <a href="https://outlinked.flatironschool.com">Outlinked</a> we used Sunspot (who I&rsquo;m not even going to give a link to) which I will never use again.  I was very pleased with how Ransack went and how easy it was to use as well as have dynamic searching.</p>

<p>Ransack was very strait forward.  This is what my html.erb file looked like.  This allowed a user to continue to drill down their search (dynamic):</p>

<p><img src="/images/ransack_view.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Then you go into the controller and set your instance variable to the results of the search:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ransack_controller.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>And bam, you get a nice dynamic search (I&rsquo;m wondering if these drop downs can be autompletes, that would probable make the UX a little better):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As my last post stated, I was planning on doing some work on searches in rails.  I have done two of them so far today with the first being Data Tables and the second being Ransack.</p>

<p>Datatables is pretty cool.  It&rsquo;s not necessarily just search but it looks like a really cool admin feature.  You can search any of the column, sort any of the columns, and have pagination really easily.</p>

<p>You are out by adding the gem then once you do that you simply give the table you are trying to sort an ID.</p>

<p><img src="/images/datatables_view.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Then go into the corresponding JS file and add a little snippet:</p>

<p><img src="/images/datatables_js.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>And magically this shows up:</p>

<p><img src="/images/datatables.png" alt="My params" /></p>
