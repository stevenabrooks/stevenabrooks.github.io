Last Friday, myself and 31 other students graduated from [The Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/).  It was a fantastic 12 weeks and an excellent start to my programming career.  We also Karaoke'd a lot Friday night and I still don't have much of a voice so that probably won't help all my interviews this week.

Either way I wanted to make a quick post today about some of my goals for the near future.

I feel strong with ruby, I feel I can make anything in ruby, but I also feel weak specifically in meta programming ruby.  So on my current to-do list, meta programming in ruby is for certain up there at the top.

Although I spent a good amount of time blogging about and working on my [Workout App](http://192.241.139.122/), I have decided to put that on the back burner for a while.  One of the things I got out of working on this application was the javascript and jQuery work.  Those are also very high on my list.  Last week I completed the first section of the [Code Avenger's](http://www.codeavengers.com/) javascript tutorial.  I have to say this style of tutorial blows all other tutorials out of the water.  Because I know ruby I really needed a javascript tutorial which would be a stickler on syntax.  Avengers is very good at that and I just wish they would create third level for javascript which is supposed to focus on objects, GUI's, and events.

Another thing that is high on my list is blogging. As I get heavy into the interviewing process there will be questions I am asked to which I do not know the answer to.  I would like to blog about specific questions that I do not know the answer to.
