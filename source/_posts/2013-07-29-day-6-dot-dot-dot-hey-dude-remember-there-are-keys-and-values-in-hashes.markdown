Got it.  Finally.  I couldn't be happier right now.  

I'm going to reflect a little here.  I've been programming for 8 weeks now.  In that time, I have learned Ruby, SQL, Git, Sintra, and now Rails.  Holy shit.  

While those are remarkable I now truly consider myself a programmer.  In my latest blog post, I mentioned that I was going down a nice long rabbit hole.  But I'm here, and you know what, I'm totally out of that rabbit hole now.  I am now able to know exactly where some of my errors are and also where I can go to get those errors solved.  On my [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17912435/nested-form-with-multiple-of-the-same-key-names), I was able to articulate my question well enough so that a true Rubyist would be able to answer my questions and for me to understand what he was saying.

Here is my form that will scale and will work.  I whooped you ass.
