Dear Everyone,

I'm sorry.  It's been a while since I last blogged.  I graduated The Flatiron School a few weeks ago and am currently running all over the joint trying to find a great job with an awesome company.  Rather than blogging, my days have been spend networking, interviewing, and running around like a mad man.

In the next few days I would like to highlight some of the things I have been working on (I have been trying out a lot of ruby gems).

Till then, have a good one,
Steven
