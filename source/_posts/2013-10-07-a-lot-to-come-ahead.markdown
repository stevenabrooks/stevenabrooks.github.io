Everyone,

Unfortunately that last few days I have not been able to update my blog due to a family emergency.  The good news is that I have still been finding a few hours here and there to get some coding work in.  In the past few days I have authenticated users with Devise and Omiauth (together) as well as added the Letsrate gem to my workout application (allowing each exercise to have a 5 star rating).  I plan on writing at least 2 post from these topics when I get a chance.  I also spun up an app with the ActiveAdmin gem but I will only be giving a link to the pseudo (a little outdated) blog I followed for it.  I will also be added a post for some of the gotcha's I encountered while setting up Rspec and FactoryGirl today.
