I'm going to try to start something new on my blog.  Unfortunately the last few weeks I haven't been able to code as much as I would have liked to (most of my time has been spent networking, interviewing, etc).  So now I'd like do a few hours a day of different rails features and log what went on here on my blog.  Today I'm going to work on search which will include manual search as well as some of the gems such as Sunspot.  Ttyl.
