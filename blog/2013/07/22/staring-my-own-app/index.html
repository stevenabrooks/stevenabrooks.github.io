<div class="entry-content"><p>For me, today is the day I have become a programmer.  Actually, it was pretty exciting and I even got a little emotional about it.  Yesterday(Sunday), I began creating my own application, and very much enjoyed making it on my own, solving some bugs on my own (or at least the ones I was able to understand). It was very exiting for someone who has only been programming for 7 weeks.  I have come very far and would like to challenge myself in creating my own app.</p>

<p>My friends are very into fitness as well as I am.  We compete in Crossfit events and I wanted to create an app where myself and my friends can input the data from each of their workouts, on top of just having a log, and being able to see their and their friends&#8217; progress visually with visual representations to track progress.</p>

<p>I would like to have a post each day, or at least try to have a post each day, or now that I am thinking about it I should make a post with each new thing I learn while building.  Actually I think I&rsquo;ll do the latter.</p>

<p>I first built three models, a routine model, and exercise model, and a lift model which is a joins between routine and exercise.  The first issue I came into was the form in which I am attempting to allow the user to create a workout along with exercises for that specific routine.  One of the first issue I found is that each time a user makes a routine, the corresponding exercises are being saved into the database as new exercises.  So if I have a &ldquo;squat&rdquo; in one workout and create a &ldquo;squat&rdquo; in another, there becomes two instances of &ldquo;squat&rdquo; in the database.  I decided to push that back because my form is already a mess.</p>

<p>In watching <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/196-nested-model-form-part-1">Nested Models</a> on <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a>, the author talks about nesting models within the form.  In my routine form, I wrote &ldquo;accepted_nested_attributes_for :exercises&rdquo;.  Now while this will allow each exercises to be nested within a routine, and with the knowledge I have in 7 weeks, I cannot get access to each exercise in the instance of the routine.</p>

<p>I realized my form is messed up.  I need to do something like &ldquo;f.label &lsquo;routine[][exercise[name]]&rdquo; or something in the form and then in the controller loop through that array of exercises and &lt;&lt; or shovel them into that instance of a routine such as &ldquo;@routine.exercises &lt;&lt; whatever_the_params_are&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For me thats a big breakthrough to be able to get this on my own.  It&rsquo;s exciting.  Being able to get the data in a way you want it to is beyond important in Rails and I feel I am on my way!</p>
