<p>The apps I made thus far have all been deployed following these guidelines:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Spike Grobstein = Beast</a></p>

<p>If you were able to successfully deploy your rails app to production via Capistrano you have done all the heavy lifting already.  If you make new changes that you would like to push to the server all you have to do is <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_GonzGonz">thanks for my boy Chris Gonzales</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go into your public folder on your local machine and write the command:</li>
</ol>


<p>cap deploy:setup</p>

<ol>
<li>Follow it up by the command:</li>
</ol>


<p>cap deploy</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I worked on another search gem this time being <a href="https://github.com/ernie/ransack">Ransack</a>.  In <a href="https://outlinked.flatironschool.com">Outlinked</a> we used Sunspot (who I&rsquo;m not even going to give a link to) which I will never use again.  I was very pleased with how Ransack went and how easy it was to use as well as have dynamic searching.</p>

<p>Ransack was very strait forward.  This is what my html.erb file looked like.  This allowed a user to continue to drill down their search (dynamic):</p>

<p><img src="/images/ransack_view.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Then you go into the controller and set your instance variable to the results of the search:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ransack_controller.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>And bam, you get a nice dynamic search (I&rsquo;m wondering if these drop downs can be autompletes, that would probable make the UX a little better):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As my last post stated, I was planning on doing some work on searches in rails.  I have done two of them so far today with the first being Data Tables and the second being Ransack.</p>

<p>Datatables is pretty cool.  It&rsquo;s not necessarily just search but it looks like a really cool admin feature.  You can search any of the column, sort any of the columns, and have pagination really easily.</p>

<p>You are out by adding the gem then once you do that you simply give the table you are trying to sort an ID.</p>

<p><img src="/images/datatables_view.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Then go into the corresponding JS file and add a little snippet:</p>

<p><img src="/images/datatables_js.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>And magically this shows up:</p>

<p><img src="/images/datatables.png" alt="My params" /></p>

Unfortunately the last few weeks I haven&rsquo;t been able to code as much as I would have liked to (most of my time has been spent networking, interviewing, etc).  So now I&rsquo;d like do a few hours a day of different rails features and log what went on here on my blog.  Today I&rsquo;m going to work on search which will include manual search as well as some of the gems such as Sunspot.  Ttyl.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Everyone,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.  It&rsquo;s been a while since I last blogged.  I graduated The Flatiron School a few weeks ago and am currently running all over the joint trying to find a great job with an awesome company.  Rather than blogging, my days have been spend networking, interviewing, and running around like a mad man.</p>

<p>In the next few days I would like to highlight some of the things I have been working on (I have been trying out a lot of ruby gems).</p>

<p>Till then, have a good one,
Steven</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So today I learned something drastically new.  One of my classmates, who just happens to be a beast at programming, went to an interview yesterday for a very prominent company here in New York.  They asked him a lot of CS questions because this was not for a junior position, and lucky, besides the fact that my friend is just really smart, he had a background in CS.  So he smoked some of these questions.</p>

<p>One of the things he thought I should have a grasp on was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O Notation</a>.  Now what I am about to say is me trying to replay the 20 minutes conversation I had with my classmate this morning.</p>

<p>O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.</p>

<p>O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.</p>

<p>O(N2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.</p>

<p>O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth will double with each additional element in the input data set.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well I had two interviews today&hellip;and on the second interview I had a questions to which i did not get the full answer to.</p>

<p>The question was, &ldquo;why should we abstract methods out of the controller and put them into the model in rails?&rdquo;  Actually i think the question was worded a little different but that&rsquo;s pretty close.</p>

<p>I answered by claiming that you want to abstract methods into the model because a messy controller would be difficult for another programmer to read your code.  Now that isn&rsquo;t wrong, but it isn&rsquo;t right either.</p>

<p>The full correct answer has to do with scope, and after some help from the friendly interviewer I was able to get the answer.   If you create a method in the controller it&rsquo;s scope is just to that specific controller.  If you make a method in the model not only does its controller and view had access to those methods but so do all the other models.</p>

<p>The scope I was introduced to in the past 12 weeks was variable scope, etc.  So this was a fun problem to work through.</p>

<p>You learn something new everyday&hellip;or at least you should try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday, myself and 31 other students graduated from <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">The Flatiron School</a>.  It was a fantastic 12 weeks and an excellent start to my programming career.  We also Karaoke&rsquo;d a lot Friday night and I still don&rsquo;t have much of a voice so that probably won&rsquo;t help all my interviews this week.</p>

<p>Either way I wanted to make a quick post today about some of my goals for the near future.</p>

<p>I feel strong with ruby, I feel I can make anything in ruby, but I also feel weak specifically in meta programming ruby.  So on my current to-do list, meta programming in ruby is for certain up there at the top.</p>

<p>Although I spent a good amount of time blogging about and working on my <a href="http://192.241.139.122/">Workout App</a>, I have decided to put that on the back burner for a while.  One of the things I got out of working on this application was the javascript and jQuery work.  Those are also very high on my list.  Last week I completed the first section of the <a href="http://www.codeavengers.com/">Code Avenger&rsquo;s</a> javascript tutorial.  I have to say this style of tutorial blows all other tutorials out of the water.  Because I know ruby I really needed a javascript tutorial which would be a stickler on syntax.  Avengers is very good at that and I just wish they would create third level for javascript which is supposed to focus on objects, GUI&rsquo;s, and events.</p>

<p>Another thing that is high on my list is blogging. As I get heavy into the interviewing process there will be questions I am asked to which I do not know the answer to.  I would like to blog about specific questions that I do not know the answer to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I learned great lessons today about responsive websites.  The first lesson it to use a site such as <a href="http://responsinator.com/">The Responsinator</a> in order to be able to see your application across multiple platforms.  Second, use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.  Bootstrap comes with a responsive CSS stylesheet so that as long as you don&rsquo;t set a height/width for certain elements, your work will just become responsive on its own.  The third part is that on some mobile devices, such as the iPhone, the device will have auto zoom-out going for some reason.  In order to combat this you need to add the line</p>

<p><img src="/images/responsive.png" alt="responsive" /></p>

<p>to your application and specifically to your layout file if you are using rails.  So rather than your site looking nice but having the iPhone zoom out like crazy, it will look something like this</p>

<p><img src="/images/photo.PNG" alt="my responsive form" /></p>

<p>So while Bootstrap is amazing and allows people like me to create responsive sites without actually making them responsive, just remember to add the snippit above to your layout file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I learned a valuable lesson this morning that I should have learned a while ago actually.  Or at least I should have picked up on this earlier.</p>

<p>Last night I was watching a few <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a> and stumble upon a few interesting CMS videos.  The one that I thought was the coolest was <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/284-active-admin">Active Admin</a>.  Active Admin it an awesome, or so I though, CMS for a rails app.</p>

<p>Although what I said above is a little all over the place the point I eventually learned was that if you really need something in your app, you need to build it yourself.  Look at the home page for Active Admin:</p>

<p><img src="/images/activeadmin.png" alt="active admin" /></p>

<p>C&#8217;mon, this looks amazing.  It apparently let&rsquo;s you filter by anything, have scope, etc., etc.  But under the cover, this gem messes with the MVC model and makes it difficult to work with your previous controllers if you are adding Active Admin on top of your app.</p>

<p>This morning I was telling a few classmates before the session started about Active Admin and how cool I thought it was.  Our head instructor, Avi Flombaum, shook his head and told me that it really wasn&rsquo;t that great.  It made think of my trading days before I became a student at <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">The Flatiron School</a>.  At first I had my charts with a million different indicators on them, and as it turned out, I really didn&rsquo;t even use any of them.  So over time I took off indicators and as I took them off my gains increased.</p>

<p>The truth is, when I was trading, I needed a little as possible.  I needed exactly the minimum for me to get the job done, so to speak.  Same goes for coding.  Yes this Active Admin looks amazing, but the truth is I don&rsquo;t need fireworks and amazing colors and anything above exactly what I need.  I have total confidence that I can make my own CMS pretty easily, and maybe make it pretty with some simple <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
