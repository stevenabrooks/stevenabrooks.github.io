  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&rsquo;m 2/3 of the way there with my javascript/jquery wants.  Yesterday I mentioned that I wanted to have a calendar to properly keep track of workout days rather than active record&rsquo;s created_at, I wanted to autocomplete the exercise name so that in the controller/model I can find_or_create_by for an exercise rather than a drop down, and I wanted to have a form that started with one exercise and a user can add as many sets to that as they choose as well as more exercises with sets.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve assumed by now I completed the first two but not the last.  Here is functioning code for the calendar:</p>

<p><img src="/images/calendar.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Here is the code I posted yesterday which was an attempt at autocomplete which didn&rsquo;t workâ€¦can you spot the errors?</p>

<p><img src="/images/autocomplete.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>From what I understand, or at least from the changes I made along with a JS Ninja (Jon Grover), I had a few semicolon issues as well as placing the array after the function.  I don&rsquo;t know for sure but it felt like I had to create the array for the autocomplete before that array is called in the function.  Here is the javascript code that allows both the calendar and the autocomplete to function properly:</p>

<p><img src="/images/working-js.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>The issue I have been having on creating a new exercise is that javascript, or at least my javascript, does like the idea of appending and ERB tag.  I&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of it though.  I&rsquo;d like to save the before and after code for the same post as I feel it would be super useful for a lot of people as it&rsquo;s own post.  Cool beans.</p>

<p>Also, over the weekend I made a ton of methods to find out certain details about my workouts, such as best sets, most weight used, % increase in total weight over time, etc.  Really pumped about those and after this form is finished up I am going to move on to different layouts so that I can graphically show the cool data I came up with.  One thing at a time though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a few days since I have blogged and consequently a few days since I have been able to work on my Workout App.  That will change this week.</p>

<p>Over the weekend when I was able to work on my app I was split between the next step to take.  I had two options: make the form better by adding Jquery to it or start making methods that will be used when a user wants to do some form of analytics on their workouts.  Although to date I prefer the backend and making methods, I decided to take a shot at the Jquery stuff, which I am a total newbie in.</p>

<p>My first stop was visiting the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">Jquery UI</a> website.  I totally love this site.  This site makes it so easy for me to do the programmers version of drop and drag for many awesome front end features.  Looking through what they have available, I realized I would like an autocomplete function for the user to choose their exercises that way as apposed to a select list that could get very long.  Also, an autocomplete function would allow me to find_or_create_by an exercise!  Next I would like to have a calendar for the user to say when that workout will or had been completed.  Although active record gives a created_at and updated_at attribute for everything in any table, a user may do a weeks worth of workouts and create the routines and information all in one day.  Active record might consider those created_at very similar times, so when a user goes to look back at their workouts overt time, I want that information to be accurate. I also would love to have a form that lists one exercise at a time and a user chooses how many sets per each exercise, and after they complete the information for one exercise and it&rsquo;s sets they create another exercise and so on.</p>

<p>Out of the three I was able to complete just the calendar.  I do not know why the autocomplete is not working and I am getting a few nice errors with my last query function.</p>

<p>Here is the current code to implement that calendar:</p>

<p><img src="/images/calendar.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Simple enough.</p>

<p>Here is my current code for the autocomplete:</p>

<p><img src="/images/autocomplete.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>The other code for creating new form fields on the fly is a mess.  Either way I will show the correct code for all of the three things I would like to do in the following days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After over a week of tinkering with my form for my workout app, spending hours with TA&rsquo;s, and even looking to the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> community, I have finally figured out my form.  I now know how to create a form where four models are being used, create all of their associations in the controller, and display them properly in the view.  That&rsquo;s Rails ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>Here is my form (which will be changed with some jquery soon):</p>

<p><img src="/images/forminter.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>The trick here was that I wanted many instances of &ldquo;lifts&rdquo; in an array, so creating the variable &ldquo;n&rdquo; and interpolating that variable into the form fields basically set &ldquo;n&rdquo; as a counter.</p>

<p>Then this is how I tied everything together in the controller (which will probably be cleaned up as some point):</p>

<p><img src="/images/workoutcontroller.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>Not bad at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got it.  Finally.  I couldn&rsquo;t be happier right now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to reflect a little here.  I&rsquo;ve been programming for 8 weeks now.  In that time, I have learned Ruby, SQL, Git, Sintra, and now Rails.  Holy shit.</p>

<p>While those are remarkable I now truly consider myself a programmer.  In my latest blog post, I mentioned that I was going down a nice long rabbit hole.  But I&rsquo;m here, and you know what, I&rsquo;m totally out of that rabbit hole now.  I am now able to know exactly where some of my errors are and also where I can go to get those errors solved.  On my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17912435/nested-form-with-multiple-of-the-same-key-names">StackOverflow question</a>, I was able to articulate my question well enough so that a true Rubyist would be able to answer my questions and for me to understand what he was saying.</p>

<p>Here is my form that will scale and will work.  I whooped you ass.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I have has multiple breakthroughs as far as my knowledge has been concerned over the last few days, I am still very stuck.  The good news is, I am now beginning to think differently about my forms.  Previously, I was worrying about the form first whereas now I am more conceded about creating the params that I want to be given from the form and then making the form first those params that I want.  Here are the current params I would like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/params.png" alt="My params" /></p>

<p>On the above code, I have a routine, which has a name.  That routine has this thing called arbitrary which means nothing.  But that routine has many lifts, each with an exercise_id and many infos(or sets) which have weight and repetitions.</p>

<p>These are the params I constructed in IRB.</p>

<p>The issue I am now having is that when I choose more than one exercise in my short form:</p>

<p><img src="/images/smallform.png" alt="My form" /></p>

<p>The params are only showing :lift once.  My guess is that it is only picking up the last exercise_id because it is overwriting each lift and just leaving the last one.  After about two hours so far today going down a rabbit hole I have decided to post my first question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.  So if anyone can help you can see my first questions <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17912435/nested-form-with-multiple-of-the-same-key-names">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So yesterday I hit a little bit of a wall.  And the good news it I&rsquo;m not too worried about it.</p>

<p>Right now I have four objects being either created or associated with in my single form.  The reason I&rsquo;m being persistent about having all of this happen in one form is because if I was a user this is the way I would want to implement my workouts.  I would want either create the workout beforehand and after my workout but in either scenario be able to implement all the exercises, sets, reps, and weight used.  If this was not the case and I had multiple forms it would be easy peasy but that&rsquo;s not what I want to do.</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;ll be working with Joe, one of the TA&rsquo;s here at Flatiron to try to get my form working this way.  If that gets done before the weekend, I would like to attempt to make this form using accepted_attributes_for.  The reason I did not do that was because a confidant of mine suggested I do otherwise as actually locating all of the nested attributes is challenging, at least for someone with less than 8 weeks of programming under his belt.  Also this weekend I am also going to be looking in AJAX because apparently that would solve my issues too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Grrrr.  Tough night last night.  The good news is that I&rsquo;m only going to have one form for this app and that&rsquo;s awesome. The bad news it that I am using four freaking models in my single form.  But the good news on that is if I can get this I will be able to crush any form in rails, which is literally one of the top three most important things about rails that I can think of.</p>

<p>One of the things I learned is that in the create method in the controller, nothing in the joins table is happening until I save the information that is in the tables that the joins table belongs to.</p>

<p>Quick post, spent a lot of time just trying to wrap my head around how I get multiple models in one form.  I realize though I can accept_nested_attributes for the sets within the lifts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So last night I was able to get about an hour of work in.  I feel like that a sustainable pace considering I do not want to have energy taken away from my Library group project.</p>

<p>Anyway I feel very strong with form now.  Yesterday, I was doing some work with my form with one of our TA&rsquo;s, Jeff, who recommended I back down from form_for and move to form_tag.  That worked wonders as there is far less rails magic involved in form_tag, and I also am literally only going to have one form for the user to input data for multiple objects.</p>

<p>Form_tag was much easier for me for many reasons.  First, I was able to create to params hash the exact way I wanted to.  This made it very easy for me to locate the the proper information in the controller and add that information into different instance variable.  That process was repetitive, which I enjoyed because I feel I made large strides yesterday as far as the M and C of the MVC model goes.</p>

<p>I also was able to add sets to lifts(which is a joins table between routine and exercises).  Now each lift has many sets which include repetitions and weights.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For me, today is the day I have become a programmer.  Actually, it was pretty exciting and I even got a little emotional about it.  Yesterday(Sunday), I began creating my own application, and very much enjoyed making it on my own, solving some bugs on my own (or at least the ones I was able to understand). It was very exiting for someone who has only been programming for 7 weeks.  I have come very far and would like to challenge myself in creating my own app.</p>

<p>My friends are very into fitness as well as I am.  We compete in Crossfit events and I wanted to create an app where myself and my friends can input the data from each of their workouts, on top of just having a log, and being able to see their and their friends&#8217; progress visually with visual representations to track progress.</p>

<p>I would like to have a post each day, or at least try to have a post each day, or now that I am thinking about it I should make a post with each new thing I learn while building.  Actually I think I&rsquo;ll do the latter.</p>

<p>I first built three models, a routine model, and exercise model, and a lift model which is a joins between routine and exercise.  The first issue I came into was the form in which I am attempting to allow the user to create a workout along with exercises for that specific routine.  One of the first issue I found is that each time a user makes a routine, the corresponding exercises are being saved into the database as new exercises.  So if I have a &ldquo;squat&rdquo; in one workout and create a &ldquo;squat&rdquo; in another, there becomes two instances of &ldquo;squat&rdquo; in the database.  I decided to push that back because my form is already a mess.</p>

<p>In watching <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/196-nested-model-form-part-1">Nested Models</a> on <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a>, the author talks about nesting models within the form.  In my routine form, I wrote &ldquo;accepted_nested_attributes_for :exercises&rdquo;.  Now while this will allow each exercises to be nested within a routine, and with the knowledge I have in 7 weeks, I cannot get access to each exercise in the instance of the routine.</p>

<p>I realized my form is messed up.  I need to do something like &ldquo;f.label &lsquo;routine[][exercise[name]]&rdquo; or something in the form and then in the controller loop through that array of exercises and &lt;&lt; or shovel them into that instance of a routine such as &ldquo;@routine.exercises &lt;&lt; whatever_the_params_are&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For me thats a big breakthrough to be able to get this on my own.  It&rsquo;s exciting.  Being able to get the data in a way you want it to is beyond important in Rails and I feel I am on my way!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a fantastic weekend at the beach I was talking to my younger brother David over a nice Paleo dinner where we absolutely crushed <a href="http://thestablerestaurant.com/">The Stable</a>.  David is a CS major and on the side develops iPhone applications.  He has made a few apps with his most popular being <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/never-have-i-ever/id401767832?mt=8">&ldquo;Never Have I Ever&rdquo;</a> and is currently creating a location based app this summer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nhie1.png" alt="David code 1" /> <img src="/images/nhie2.png" alt="David code 1" /></p>

<p>I was explaining to him why I believe native was garbage and so we were talking about some of the things he enjoyed and didn&rsquo;t enjoy as far as iPhone development.  We talked for a while and I remember he said a few interesting things about Objective C and specifically native applications in general.  Because I paid for dinner he was kind enough to answer a few questions:</p>

<p>Steven: What are some of the difficulties in using objective C?</p>

<p>David: A major complaint that a lot of programmers have relating to Objective-C is that a Mac is required in order to actually write and compile your Objective-C code.  It is unfortunate that Apple does not allow the development of Objective-C on a Windows based platform.  This denial of Windows based developers means that if someone wants to develop for the iPhone/iPad/Mac, you must first pay Apple to get a Mac and then pay Apple $99 yearly to be part of their developer program.  In terms of actual code writing, I do wish that it was easier to test your app on multiple devices.  In order to test a singular app on multiple iPhones, you have to collect the device id and create a Provisioning Profile, which is basically a certificate that allows the app to run, and distribute that profile to every device you want to use.  This makes it a big challenge if I want to, for example, show my brothers my latest app and let them fool around with it and provide feedback.</p>

<p>Steven: What do you think could be easier in developing with objective C?</p>

<p>David: One thing that I would like to be easier about Objective-C is how it uses Frameworks.  Frameworks in Objective-C are like libraries in C or like packages in Java that you must import in order to use their information.  It is annoying to have to figure out what Framework you need to include in order to use a certain piece of code.  It would be a lot easier if all the Frameworks that have been created and are available to you to use and just automatically imported by the compiler when needed.  All the Frameworks we use are already included in iOS or OS X, so why can&rsquo;t the device choose the needed Frameworks instead of me telling it to?</p>

<p>Steven: Do you feel objective C will be around in three years?</p>

<p>David: Yes I believe that Objective-C will still be around and heavily used in three years time.  We are currently in an evolving technological world which has transitioned to computers the size of rooms to handheld computers and smartphones.  I must point out that, Objective-C has not created solely for the iPhone.  Objective-C was created by Apple for the Mac and Mac OS X.  Once the iPhone came around, it was then transformed to work with iOS as well.  Therefore, in addition to the ever growing mobile market, the fact that Objective-C is used to build applications for the Mac means that it will endure through the years.</p>

<p>Steven: Why did you choose to learn objective C over web application languages?</p>

<p>David: When I was a Sophomore in high school, I taught myself C++ and a little bit of Java.  I had no previous knowledge or involvement with HTML or web development and decided to focus on software engineering.  Then, the invention of the iPhone came around and I was hooked.  I saw it as this awesome new product that everyone would be talking about and so turned my attention to mobile development.  It is very interesting to point out that, I am a rising Junior at Loyola University Maryland, aiming for a BS of Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, and yet, I have never once touched HTML.  In fact, HTML is not even in the CS curriculum because our faculty believe that it is such a basic and easy language that they do not even bother teaching it to us.  Instead, we are to learn it ourselves outside of the classroom if desired.</p>

<p>Pretty interesting stuff.  I definitely learned quite a bit from talking to him.  We are both programmers and learning completely different things.</p>

<p>I was telling him as much as I could about Active Record because I am just obsessed with the type of magic it provides to me and I asked him to show me his code for importing data into his database, saving it, and displaying it.  This is what I got in return:</p>

<p><img src="/images/davidcode1.png" alt="David code 1" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/davidcode2.png" alt="David code 2" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/davidcode3.png" alt="David code 3" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/davidcode4.png" alt="David code 4" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/davidcode5.png" alt="David code 5" /></p>

<p>So somewhere in here he is getting a users location and storing it into a SQL database, then saving it, then making it available.  Apparently in Objective C you have to make methods on methods on methods for a lot of things that with Active Record you can simply run a migrate.  I also realize that the way I presented this code makes it look like databasing in Objective C is the worst thing in the world.  There is a good amount of code here for actually finding the location of the users, but it is still a lot.</p>

<p>Thanks David for letting me interview you.</p>
